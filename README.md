  This project is a Keras trained neural network wrapped in a single page flask app packaged with docker and deployed on GCP's Kubernetes Engine. Users enter a search term and tweets containing these terms are scraped with Twitter's public API and passed through my trained neural network to determine their sentiment. The results are displayed for the user and allow the tracking of sentiment for people, places or companies in near real time!

  This neural network can be used by brands to monitor potentially flattering or problematic memetic trends on Twitter before they go viral, allowing the brand to interject themselves appropriately.
